# Visually 🧠🖼️

**Visually** is a powerful web app that uses Hugging Face models to generate and process images through text prompts. Whether you're exploring AI-generated art or testing image-based models, Visually offers a streamlined interface built with **Streamlit** for instant results.

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Hugging Face API Key Required

To use this application, **you MUST have your own [Hugging Face API key](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)**.  
Sign in or create an account on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co), then generate your token under your account settings.

You’ll need to paste this token when prompted by the app.
